          The Iota Phi Chapter was founded on February 18, 1978 under Delta Beta Chapter at Syracuse University with the crossing of <em>Thirteen Deadly Sins</em>. This unique dual-campus line connects brothers from Iota Phi and Delta Beta, forging a special bond between the two chapters at a time when the Black student population at both schools was small. Wayne Brown served as Dean of Pledges, guiding the pioneering line of thirteen through the Burning Sands: Larry Brown, Keith Brown, Glenn Cobb, Naketo Scott, Guillermo Lynch, Alvin Johnson, Gene Wethers, Calvin Gibson, Gary Harrell, Eugene Hamlett, Cornell Gibson, Ken Boddie, and Winston Johnson.

          Later that same year, in Spring 1978, Iota Phi welcomed its second line, <em>Sinister Six</em>, comprised of Anthony Bass, Dennis Williams, Antonio Wilkins, Eric Richardson, Cedric Carter, and Michael Davis. It was these two lines that gave Kappa Alpha Psi® Fraternity, Inc. a presence on Cornell University's Ithaca campus. Gary Harrell served as Dean of Pledges for this line, further solidifying the chapter's early foundation at Cornell University. The line crossed the Burning Sands on December 10, 1978.

          On September 22, 1979, Iota Phi received its official charter, becoming the third chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi® Fraternity, Inc. at an Ivy League institution and the seventh chapter in New York State. The chapter's influence extended beyond Cornell University, including men enrolled at Ithaca College and Mansfield University, establishing the Sin Chapter as a beacon of brotherhood and Black excellence in Upstate New York. Since its inception, Iota Phi has initiated over 100 men who are constantly striving to uphold the fraternity's motto: "achievement in every field of human endeavor". Today, the chapter actively participates in community service efforts to benefit both Cornell University and the Ithaca community.
